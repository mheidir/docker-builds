Each folder represents the build of a single dockerized container.
Some files are not included in the repository, for example Micetro central, web application and controller. Only the scripts are shared.

Inside each folder contains the ./dstart.sh which will help to build and run the image once it is successfully compiled.
./destroy.sh terminates the container and removes from Docker.
